Here are the only 2 things must be manually fixed after a full terraform destroy:

1. Update GoDaddy → NEW Route53 nameservers
Terraform will provide a different set every time a new hosted zone is created.
That is the biggest manual step.

2. Update GitHub (chris-nelson-dev) → NEW IAM user credentials + New Distribution
Because destroying the IAM access key means loss of the associated secrets.

New apply = new keys = update GitHub secrets:

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
AWS_DISTRIBUTION_ID
